    <div class="text">Given East Liberty’s recent resurgence, it is a prime example of how a location’s inhabitants can negatively impact the area, but at the same time how people have the propensity to improve their surroundings and renew life to the area they inhabit.  
Prior to the area’s focus on urban renewal, East Liberty was in a depressed state for over 40 years. Problems in the area began in the late 1950s and early 1960s when as stated in Smith’s Pittsburgh Then and Now, “East Liberty fell victim to the good intentions of the Urban Redevelopment Authority. By the time city planners had finished reorganizing the streets, tearing down houses, and [creating] a mall, the area had become so confusing, that people tended to avoid East Liberty all together.” In the early 1950s, East Liberty was Pennsylvania’s third largest shopping district and had more than 500 business, supported by a population of 14,000. By the 1980s, and after all the redevelopment, this area had lost half of its population and over one million square feet of commercial space. As we walked through East Liberty, the combined efforts of city developers and the city’s inhabitants was readily apparent. By restoring the city grid to the area, East Liberty is becoming a desirable location for inhabitants from surrounding neighborhoods, further increasing the interaction between people and spurring further renewal in the area. The recent influx of large national retail stores such as Home Depot and Target is a sign that the commercial aspect of the area is improving. Perhaps one of the biggest additions to the East Liberty area is the housing of Google’s offices in what previously was a Nabisco factory. Ultimately, the people have shaped this area to fit their dense, transient state of mind over time.</div>
