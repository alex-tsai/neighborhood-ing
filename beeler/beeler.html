    <div class="text">Beeler St. is an example of location defining the people. Due to its close proximity to Carnegie Mellon University campus, the people who inhabit this street are predominantly college students. Compared to other streets that are not adjacent to campus, Beeler St. adopts a livelihood reflecting this demographic. This is made evident by the absence of manicured lawns and the presence of trash littered sidewalks. In some ways, it is also the behavior of people living here that shapes the location, but in this instance, location is the primary factor that defines the type of person who lives here. </div>
