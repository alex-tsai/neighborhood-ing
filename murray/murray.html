    <div class="text">Though the environment in Murray Hill definitely shapes the way the inhabitants live, we start to get a glimpse of how the opposite can happen. 
The hill itself portrays an interesting correlation between elevation and wealth. In this neighborhood, the homes in higher altitude demonstrate more wealth and extravagance than those in lower altitudes. The physical topography reveals a “money trickling down” concept, and thus influences the lives of the inhabitants. Also, the close proximity to the Chatham University adds a slightly more vibrant atmosphere. In past years, Chatham bought surrounding property in Murray Hill and converted it to campus extensions. Though taking away from the old atmosphere, this change added a new quality of life here. Lastly, as “one of the most architecturally diverse streets in Pittsburgh,” this street definitely gives off a cultured impression. This culture is definitely employed by the people who live in those homes, which can be inferred by the respect they have for each other and for their property.
However, Murray Hill starts to hint at the possibility of people changing the environment as well. From my 3 interviews, I discovered that a major part of the lives of the people at Murray are the daily interactions they have with their neighbors. From collaborative dog walking to sending kids to play-dates to participating in competitive dog competitions, there are many ways in which these people interact with each other, and in turn, affect each others’ lives. </div>

When asked about her impressions of the neighborhood, she stressed that it was incredibly “family friendly” and that it was a great place to raise her son. She loved how much history it has, and that it is a good central location surrounded by East Liberty and Squirrel Hill. She is very good friends with her neighbors, even sharing a driveway with one of them.</div>

    <div><h3>Anonymous woman with her dog, Dash.</h3>
    <div>This woman spoke very highly of her neighborhood. Though she does not live on Murray Hill Ave., she frequently interacts with people who do live there when she walks her dog. She says that it is sometimes difficult to interact with her neighbors without walking her dog because she doesn’t have very many opportunities or reasons to.</div>
